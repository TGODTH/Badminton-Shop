# E-Commerce Website Project: PHP, MySQL, Apache, XAMPP, Bootstrap
This project is a demonstration of my skills in programming, teaching, coaching, and web development. I collaborated with a friend on this e-commerce website project for their homework in their second year of vocational school.

## The Project
The purpose of this project was to create a simple e-commerce website using PHP, MySQL, Apache, XAMPP, and Bootstrap. My friend had a basic understanding of web development, but I helped them with the programming aspect of the project and taught them about the technologies we used.

### Programming
I wrote most of the PHP and MySQL code for this project, and I also taught my friend about the basic principles of web development. I explained how Apache and XAMPP work, and I helped them troubleshoot issues they encountered while developing the website.

### Teaching & Coaching
I shared my knowledge of web development with my friend and guided them through the project by asking questions and giving feedback on their work. I challenged them to come up with ideas and solutions on their own and helped them develop critical thinking skills.

### Web Development
The e-commerce website features a list of items for sale, a shopping cart, a registration and login system for clients, and the ability for clients to purchase items and change the quantity at the checkout page. We used Bootstrap to make the website responsive and user-friendly.

## Project Details
* The project can be installed by simply placing the project folder in the htdocs directory of XAMPP.
* The website is built using PHP, MySQL, Apache, XAMPP, and Bootstrap.
* The website includes a list of items for sale, a shopping cart, a registration and login system for clients, and the ability for clients to purchase items and change the quantity at the checkout page.
## Accomplishments
